//! Touch gesture recognition vocabulary.
//!
//! GPUI recognizes gestures from raw [`TouchEvent`](crate::TouchEvent)s in a
//! single, portable arena in rgpui core: recognizers compete for in-flight
//! touches, winners claim them, and losers are cancelled. Recognized gestures
//! are surfaced through *existing* semantic events wherever possible, a tap
//! becomes [`ClickEvent::Touch`](crate::ClickEvent), a pan becomes
//! [`ScrollWheelEvent`](crate::ScrollWheelEvent)s carrying a
//! [`TouchPhase`](crate::TouchPhase), and a pinch becomes
//! [`PinchEvent`](crate::PinchEvent)s 鈥?so components written against
//! `on_click` and scroll containers work untouched on mobile.
